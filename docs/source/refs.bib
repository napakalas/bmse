  abstract = {An integrative, systems approach to the modelling of brain energy metabolism is presented. Mechanisms such as glutamate cycling between neurons and astrocytes and glycogen storage in astrocytes have been implemented. A unique feature of the model is its calibration using in vivo data of brain glucose and lactate from freely moving rats under various stimuli. The model has been used to perform simulated perturbation experiments that show that glycogen breakdown in astrocytes is significantly activated during sensory (tail pinch) stimulation. This mechanism provides an additional input of energy substrate during high consumption phases. By way of validation, data from the perfusion of 50\,\textmu M propranolol in the rat brain was compared with the model outputs. Propranolol affects the glucose dynamics during stimulation, and this was accurately reproduced in the model by a reduction in the glycogen breakdown in astrocytes. The model's predictive capacity was verified by using data from a sensory stimulation (restraint) that was not used for model calibration. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the model parameters, this showed that the control of energy metabolism and transport processes are critical in the metabolic behaviour of cerebral tissue.},

  abstract = {A mathematical model of the cardiac ventricular action potential is presented. In our previous work, the membrane Na+ current and K+ currents were formulated. The present article focuses on processes that regulate intracellular Ca2+ and depend on its concentration. The model presented here for the mammalian ventricular action potential is based mostly on the guinea pig ventricular cell. However, it provides the framework for modeling other types of ventricular cells with appropriate modifications made to account for species differences. The following processes are formulated: Ca2+ current through the L-type channel (ICa), the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger, Ca2+ release and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), buffering of Ca2+ in the SR and in the myoplasm, a Ca2+ pump in the sarcolemma, the Na(+)-K+ pump, and a nonspecific Ca(2+)-activated membrane current. Activation of ICa is an order of magnitude faster than in previous models. Inactivation of ICa depends on both the membrane voltage and [Ca2+]i. SR is divided into two subcompartments, a network SR (NSR) and a junctional SR (JSR). Functionally, Ca2+ enters the NSR and translocates to the JSR following a monoexponential function. Release of Ca2+ occurs at JSR and can be triggered by two different mechanisms, Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release and spontaneous release. The model provides the basis for the study of arrhythmogenic activity of the single myocyte including afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. It can simulate cellular responses under different degrees of Ca2+ overload. Such simulations are presented in our accompanying article in this issue of Circulation Research.},

  abstract = {A mathematical model of the membrane action potential of the mammalian ventricular cell is introduced. The model is based, whenever possible, on recent single-cell and single-channel data and incorporates the possibility of changing extracellular potassium concentration [K]o. The fast sodium current, INa, is characterized by fast upstroke velocity (Vmax = 400 V/sec) and slow recovery from inactivation. The time-independent potassium current, IK1, includes a negative-slope phase and displays significant crossover phenomenon as [K]o is varied. The time-dependent potassium current, IK, shows only a minimal degree of crossover. A novel potassium current that activates at plateau potentials is included in the model. The simulated action potential duplicates the experimentally observed effects of changes in [K]o on action potential duration and rest potential. Physiological simulations focus on the interaction between depolarization and repolarization (i.e., premature stimulation). Results demonstrate the importance of the slow recovery of INa in determining the response of the cell. Simulated responses to periodic stimulation include monotonic Wenckebach patterns and alternans at normal [K]o, whereas at low [K]o nonmonotonic Wenckebach periodicities, aperiodic patterns, and enhanced supernormal excitability that results in unstable responses ("chaotic activity") are observed. The results are consistent with recent experimental observations, and the model simulations relate these phenomena to the underlying ionic channel kinetics.},

In the companion article (O'Rourke B, Kass DA, Tomaselli GF, K\"a\"ab S, Tunin R, Marb\'an E. Mechanisms of altered excitation-contraction coupling in canine tachycardia-induced heart, I: experimental studies. Circ Res. 1999;84:562-570), O'Rourke et al show that Ca2+ transients recorded in myocytes isolated from canine hearts subjected to the tachycardia pacing protocol exhibit similar responses. Analyses of protein levels in these failing hearts reveal that both SR Ca2+ ATPase and phospholamban are decreased on average by 28\% and that Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) protein is increased on average by 104\%. In this article, we present a model of the canine midmyocardial ventricular action potential and Ca2+ transient. The model is used to estimate the degree of functional upregulation and downregulation of NCX and SR Ca2+ ATPase in heart failure using data obtained from 2 different experimental protocols. Model estimates of average SR Ca2+ ATPase functional downregulation obtained using these experimental protocols are 49\% and 62\%. Model estimates of average NCX functional upregulation range are 38\% and 75\%. Simulation of voltage-clamp Ca2+ transients indicates that such changes are sufficient to account for the reduced amplitude, altered shape, and slowed relaxation of Ca2+ transients in the failing canine heart. Model analyses also suggest that altered expression of Ca2+ handling proteins plays a significant role in prolongation of action potential duration in failing canine myocytes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence suggests that heterogeneity of ion channel expression and electrophysiological characteristics is an important property of the ventricular myocardium. The 2 components of the delayed rectifier potassium current, IKr (rapid) and IKs (slow), play a dominant role in the repolarization of the action potential and are important determinants of its duration. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this report, the effects of heterogeneities of IKr and IKs on action potential duration (APD) and its rate dependence (adaptation) are studied with the use of the LRd model of a mammalian ventricular cell. Results demonstrate the importance of IKs density variations in heterogeneity of repolarization. Cells with reduced IKs (eg, mid-myocardial M cells) display long APD and steep dependence of APD on rate. Mechanistically, accumulation of IKs activation and increased sodium calcium exchange current, INaCa, secondary to Na+ accumulation at a fast rate underlie the steep APD-rate relation of these cells. When cells are electrotonically coupled in a multicellular fiber through resistive gap junction, APD differences are reduced. The results demonstrate strong dependence of APD heterogeneity on the degree of intercellular coupling even in the normal physiological range. Highly reduced coupling maximizes APD heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity of IKs:IKr density strongly influences APD and its rate dependence. However, in the intact myocardium, the degree of gap-junction coupling may be an important factor that determines the manifestation of APD heterogeneity and dispersion of repolarization. The clinical significance of this study is in the context of repolarization abnormalities and associated arrhythmias (eg, long QT syndrome and torsade de pointes).},

  abstract = {Sodium overload of cardiac cells can accompany various pathologies and induce fatal cardiac arrhythmias. We investigate effects of elevated intracellular sodium on the cardiac action potential (AP) and on intracellular calcium using the Luo-Rudy model of a mammalian ventricular myocyte. The results are: 1) During rapid pacing, AP duration (APD) shortens in two phases, a rapid phase without Na(+) accumulation and a slower phase that depends on [Na(+)](i). 2) The rapid APD shortening is due to incomplete deactivation (accumulation) of I(Ks). 3) The slow phase is due to increased repolarizing currents I(NaK) and reverse-mode I(NaCa), secondary to elevated [Na(+)](i). 4) Na(+)-overload slows the rate of AP depolarization, allowing time for greater I(Ca(L)) activation; it also enhances reverse-mode I(NaCa). The resulting increased Ca(2+) influx triggers a greater [Ca(2+)](i) transient. 5) Reverse-mode I(NaCa) alone can trigger Ca(2+) release in a voltage and [Na(+)](i)-dependent manner. 6) During I(NaK) block, Na(+) and Ca(2+) accumulate and APD shortens due to enhanced reverse-mode I(NaCa); contribution of I(K(Na)) to APD shortening is negligible. By slowing AP depolarization (hence velocity) and shortening APD, Na(+)-overload acts to enhance inducibility of reentrant arrhythmias. Shortened APD with elevated [Ca(2+)](i) (secondary to Na(+)-overload) also predisposes the myocardium to arrhythmogenic delayed afterdepolarizations.},

  abstract = {Maximising FAIRness of biosimulation models requires a comprehensive description of model entities such as reactions, variables, and components. The COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork (COMBINE) community encourages the use of RDF with composite annotations that semantically involve ontologies to ensure completeness and accuracy. These annotations facilitate scientists to find models or detailed information to inform further reuse, such as model composition, reproduction, and curation. SPARQL has been recommended as a key standard to access semantic annotation with RDF, which helps get entities precisely. However, SPARQL is not suitable for most repository users who explore biosimulation models freely without adequate knowledge regarding ontologies, RDF structure, and SPARQL syntax. We propose here a text-based information retrieval approach, CASBERT, that is easy to use and can present candidates of relevant entities from models across a repository's contents. CASBERT adapts Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), where each composite annotation about an entity is converted into an entity embedding for subsequent storage in a list-like structure. For entity lookup, a query is transformed to a query embedding and compared to the entity embeddings, and then the entities are displayed in order based on their similarity. The simple list-like structure makes it possible to implement CASBERT as an efficient search engine product, with inexpensive addition, modification, and insertion of entity embedding. To demonstrate and test CASBERT, we created a dataset for testing from the Physiome Model Repository and a static export of the BioModels database consisting of query-entities pairs. Measured using Mean Average Precision and Mean Reciprocal Rank, we found that our approach can perform better than the traditional bag-of-words method.},
